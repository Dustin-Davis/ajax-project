# Hyrule-Compendium

A web application for people who want to know the attack and defence and location for all weapons in The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild.

I built this web app for people like me who like to collect all things in video games and to make it easier to locate the weapons. 

You can check this web app out here: https://dustin-davis.github.io/hyrule-compendium/

A dynamic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript solo project.

Some featurs that i have implemented are:

-User can see a picture of the equipment.

-User can see a description of the items. 

-User can see attack and defense.
